This project was just the introduction to HTML, so all I did was create a landing page that links to three recipe pages filled with lists, paragraphs, and images.
I demonstrated my proficency in four things in this project:
1. Basic HTML setup and useage
2. Working with text and lists in HTML
3. Working with images and links in HTML
4. Using Git in an useful manner
