    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        These tacos remind me of my great aunt <em>Juniper</em> who fought in all three world wars. She didn't 
        have much time to spend with us on account of all her fellow time travelers who were trying to kill her 
        for talking about WW3. So we made these tacos in a quick hurry whenever she came over. I remember
        munching on these while asking how she found that time-travel ring she always wore. Apparantly it was 
        her late husband's before he was <strong>asssassinated</strong> by the time traveler's secret society. 
        Oh, and I guess these tacos taste alright.
